# Dashboard Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully transformed the dashboard at `/dashboard` into an OpenRouter-style interface with logs, API keys management, and analytics pages.

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema Extensions (`apps/web/db/schema.ts`)

Added new tables for API gateway functionality:

- **apiKeys**: Store user API keys with name, key value, usage tracking
- **apiLogs**: Track all API requests with model, tokens, cost, latency, status
- **userCredits**: Manage user credit balances (pay-as-you-go model)
- **creditTransactions**: Track all credit purchases and usage

### 2. Dashboard Layout (`apps/web/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`)

- Sticky top navigation bar with tabs
- Responsive mobile menu
- Active tab highlighting with smooth animations
- Navigation items: Overview, Logs, API Keys, Analytics

### 3. Dashboard Pages

#### Overview (`/dashboard`)

- Stats cards: Total Requests, Total Spent, Credits Remaining, Avg Latency
- Recent activity feed with latest API calls
- Top models usage chart
- Quick action cards linking to other sections

#### Logs Page (`/dashboard/logs`)

- Real-time request/response tracking table
- Search by model or provider
- Filter by status (all/success/error)
- Displays: timestamp, model, tokens (input/output), cost, latency, status
- Color-coded status indicators

#### API Keys Page (`/dashboard/keys`)

- Create new API keys with custom names
- Show/hide key values with toggle
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Last used timestamp tracking
- Revoke/delete keys with confirmation
- Security warning banner

#### Analytics Page (`/dashboard/analytics`)

- Time range selector (7d/30d/90d)
- Key metrics: requests, spending, latency, success rate
- Daily usage chart with bar visualization
- Usage by model breakdown with percentages
- Cost tracking per model

## Features Implemented

### UI/UX

- Dark theme with glassmorphism effects
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Hover states and transitions
- Color-coded status indicators (green=success, red=error)
- Font mono for technical data (keys, timestamps, metrics)

### Functionality

- Mock data structure ready for API integration
- Search and filter capabilities
- Modal dialogs for key creation
- Clipboard operations
- Real-time data visualization
- Percentage-based progress bars

## File Structure

```
apps/web/app/dashboard/
├── layout.tsx                      # Main dashboard layout with navigation
├── page.tsx                        # Overview page (entry point)
├── DashboardOverviewClient.tsx     # Overview client component
├── logs/
│   ├── page.tsx                    # Logs page server component
│   └── LogsClient.tsx              # Logs client component

└── analytics/
    ├── page.tsx                    # Analytics page server component
    └── AnalyticsClient.tsx         # Analytics client component
```

## Next Steps (Not Implemented)

### Backend Integration

1. Create API endpoints for:
   - Fetching real API logs from database
   - Creating/revoking API keys
   - Fetching analytics data
   - Managing user credits

2. Database migrations:
   - Run migrations to create new tables
   - Seed initial data if needed

3. Authentication:
   - Ensure all dashboard routes are protected
   - Add user-specific data filtering

### Additional Features

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket or polling for live log updates
2. **Export Functionality**: Download logs as CSV/JSON
3. **Advanced Filters**: Date range, model type, cost range
4. **Alerts**: Set up notifications for high usage or errors
5. **Rate Limiting**: Display and manage rate limits per key
6. **Billing Integration**: Connect to payment processor for credit purchases
7. **Usage Quotas**: Set spending limits and alerts

## Testing

- Build completed successfully ✓
- All routes generated correctly ✓
- TypeScript compilation passed ✓
- No runtime errors ✓

## Design Philosophy

Followed OpenRouter's approach:

- Clean, professional interface
- Transparent pricing/cost display
- Developer-focused (monospace fonts, technical details)
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Self-service API key management
